## Various Codewars solutions.

Yeah basicaly just a bunch of solutions as I work through them, just to improve problem solving and data handling and a bit of practice for technical interviews I suppose but also because it's quite fun.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- - This also holds all the levels of difficulty ranging from 8 being the easiest all the way upto hopefully 1, as of now I think the 1 challenges are way out of reach.
 
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
