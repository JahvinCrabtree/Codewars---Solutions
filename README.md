## Various Codewars solutions.

Yeah basicaly just a bunch of solutions as I work through them, just to improve problem solving and data handling and a bit of practice for technical interviews I suppose but also because it's quite fun.

## 11/07 Update - We doing leetcodes now.

Yeah, we graduated to leetcode solutions now. There's a few in there, just trying to build up more confidence with the different datastructures and again improve the way I approach problenms and work through tasks. It's all practice really. Trying to make atleast 1 commit a day and see how long I can do it for. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- - This also holds all the levels of difficulty ranging from 8 being the easiest all the way upto hopefully 1, as of now I think the 1 challenges are way out of reach.
 
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
